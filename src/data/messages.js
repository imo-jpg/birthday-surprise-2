        message: "Peter, Congratulations on your 60th birthday!  Six decades is a big milestone and I am wishing you nothing but health and happiness in the future. It’s been a long time since our days at Stanford.  I remember fondly the interesting colloquia and discussions, the towering figures we learned from, and being surly and inefficient to undergrads!  You have been a huge inspiration to me, and I’m sure many others.  I have always admired your intelligence, creativity, insight, and productivity. You are a true scientist, posing smart questions, seeking answers, without following fads or trends.  But what I want most to say is that I am grateful for your friendship; it means a lot to me.  You’ve been there for me and supported me in tough times. I know that you and your wonderful family will have many more joyous years ahead and I look forward to our continued friendship. So, all the best on your birthday!",
