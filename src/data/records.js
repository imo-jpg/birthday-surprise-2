And music ties together so many of my happy memories of you, whether that's jamming out on LZAD or coming back from tae-kwon-do to hear some ethereally haunting classical music on the radio. I hope hearing all these songs brings back some happy memories of your own!

I hope you have lots of exciting activities planned along with tasty (but weird) foods to celebrate. \n \n I know you know this, but I’ll say it again anyway. Aside from my parents, you are the mentor I most look up to. In the way I conduct research, how I interacted with my students back at Indianapolis, and even how I approach challenges and setbacks, I have been molded by your influence. Teaching that future-thinking course together was one of my favorite parts of college, and our covid projects were exciting and a lot of fun to undertake; they helped keep me sane through Teach for America (oh and get me into grad school!). I’m excited to continue fleshing them out to finally get to the story we really want to share with the world. :) \n \n Per Imogen and Graham’s request, I also want to share a song. The one that came to mind first was Heroes by David Bowie. Please don’t interpret that in any weird sort of romantic way because of the lyrics—it’s just a great song, and you were the first person who showed it to me. Oh, and since their new album, 10,000 Gecs came out, I’ve gotta share a song from 100 Gecs. One of the more popular songs from that album, Dumbest Girl Alive, has some interesting sounds; it’s quite a different vibe from their earlier work. Give it a listen! If you like it, then welcome to the hyper-pop fan club, and if you hate it, please blame your children for soliciting a questionable source for recommendations. \n \n I can’t wait to hang out in a few weeks! Until then, enjoy the beautiful spring!`,

My friend invited them to play at Wesleyan back in 2004, and they agreed on the condition that we make them dinner beforehand... definitely a bonus from my perspective!

        message: `Dear Peter, I picked 'TV Glotzer' (Engl.: TV gazer) by Nina Hagen as a birthday song for you. Released in 1978, it may be the first reference of "choice overload" in popular culture (at least the first that I'm aware of). As we both know, the effect is spurious, but many people assume it's real. Nina Hagen articulates that intuition in minute 1:03 (youtube video, 1:18 on Spotify) where she sings "Ich kann mich gar nicht entscheiden, ist alles so schön bunt hier". Besides the lyrics, I think the song is also a nice fit because it's from Germany and Nina Hagen is originally from Berlin but later had a career in the US. Last but not least, Nina Hagen continues to be a very creative, energetic, and fun person, which I think suits you well. So I hope you will enjoy the song at your 60th birthday - punk never dies!`,

I have fond memories of our wide-ranging discussions, from octopus intelligence to the wonders of Ultraman. Strangely, I don't think we ever discussed music. Maybe we did, but I can't recall; I’m fast approaching 60 too. Recently, I discovered Steve Reich. I expect you know his work, but if not, I hope you find his music as transfixing as I do. When we next share a meal, I’ll be sure to ask you about what you’ve been listening to. Wishing you all the best as you pass into the next decade.`,
